Improbable Meat, a startup meat company is investigating how to synthesize meat from human belly button bacteria. They've gathered sample from test subject's belly button bacteria. This belly button bacteria was analyzed and displayed in a dashboard. The dashboard in the index.html webpage shows the amount and types of belly button bacteria, as well as the number of weekly washes, which will help determine the likelihood of the bacteria being able to be synthesized to meat. This is an interactive dashboard, so you can selecct the user id in the top right corner to display graphs for each user's bellybutton data.
